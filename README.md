## Temporary Notice

This project is an experimental playground for procedural generation, inspired by the atmosphere and themes of the Backrooms.

Everything you see here is **subject to change**. Systems, mechanics, textures, and even core design ideas may be replaced or heavily reworked as the project evolves.

Some visual or audio assets currently rely on placeholder or third-party content until custom replacements are created.

Use this repository with the understanding that it is an active prototype rather than a finished product.
